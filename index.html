            <p>Hello, my name is Seth and I'm a Web Developer.</p>

            <p>The Early Years --</p>
            <br>


            <p>I'm a New-Jerseyan by birth and raised in a little tiny suburb
            of Warren County. Growing up I was constantly taking things apart,
            much to the chargrin of my parents who constantly had to buy new
            electronics. Seeing my passion with technology, my father allowed
            me to use his Windows 3.1 machine. That was after I agreed to NEVER
            take the computer apart.... I only took it apart once. Just don't
            tell him!!</p>
            <br>
            The Later Years --<br>
            After graduating high school in 2007, I studied Computer Science at
            Raritan Valley Community College. A few short years later I
            graduated Cum Laude with my Associates degree. Fast forward a few
            short years, intermingled with a part-time job at Aeropostale and
            I'm now attending The Rutgers Coding Bootcamp to further my
            understanding of Web Programming.
